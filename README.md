# Situation
A consumer finance company specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. A key challenge faced by the company is determining the creditworthiness of applicants with insufficient or non-existent credit histories. This can lead to two types of risks:

Opportunity Loss: Rejecting applicants who could repay the loan, thereby losing potential business.
Financial Loss: Approving applicants who are likely to default, resulting in financial losses.
The company aims to reduce these risks by analyzing loan application data to identify patterns that predict loan repayment behavior.

# Task

The goal of the project is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to:
-Identify key factors that influence loan repayment and default behavior.
-Segment customers into different risk profiles based on their attributes and past behavior.
-Provide actionable insights that help optimize loan approval processes, such as:
-Identifying applicants likely to default.
-Proposing tailored actions like reducing loan amounts, applying higher interest rates, or denying loans.

# Action

To address the task, the following steps were taken:
-Data Understanding:
Studied the dataset containing consumer and loan attributes.
Reviewed independent variables such as demographic data, loan terms, and repayment histories.

-Data Cleaning:
Addressed missing values and handled outliers.
Standardized variables for uniformity and ensured data quality.

-Exploratory Data Analysis:
Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to uncover relationships between variables and default rates.
Investigated correlations between consumer attributes (e.g., age, income, employment status) and loan repayment outcomes.
Identified high-risk segments based on repayment behaviors, such as late payments.

-Key Insights:
Created visualizations (histograms, scatterplots, and heatmaps) to highlight patterns.
Segmented loan decisions into categories: Approved, Cancelled, Refused, and Unused offers, analyzing their underlying causes.
Flagged variables with strong predictive power for default risk, such as debt-to-income ratio and credit history.

-Recommendations:
Developed strategies for mitigating risks, including:
Lending to risky applicants at higher interest rates.
Setting thresholds for loan amounts and repayment periods based on risk profiles.
Automating decision-making processes using the insights obtained.


# Result

-Identified key driver variables influencing default, such as loan tenure, credit history, and income stability.
-Provided actionable recommendations that helped the company:
-Minimize financial losses by optimizing loan approval criteria.
-Improve customer retention by offering appropriate loan amounts to creditworthy applicants.
-Laid the groundwork for future risk analytics efforts, enabling the company to deploy predictive models for real-time decision-making.
